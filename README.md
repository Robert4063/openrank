## Health Assessment Algorithm

### PHAM - Project Health Assessment Model
The core algorithm that quantifies open source project health, outputting a score from **0 to 100**.

### General Formula
$$ M = 0.2 \times Growth + 0.4 \times Activity + 0.2 \times Contribution + 0.2 \times Code $$

### Four-Dimensional Assessment System

| Dimension | Weight | Core Metric | Description |
|-----------|:------:|-------------|-------------|
| **Growth** | 20% | Star / Fork Growth Rate | Community Interest Heat |
| **Activity** | 40% | Commit Trend + OpenDigger | Development Activity (Core) |
| **Contribution** | 20% | PR Trend | Community Contribution Heat |
| **Code Churn** | 20% | Code Churn (Logarithmic) | Development Throughput |

### Detailed Calculation Logic

#### ⭐ Growth (Interest Growth) — 20%
- **Star Growth Rate**: $x = (\text{This Month Star} / (\text{Prev 3 Months Avg Star} + 1)) \times 100$
- **Fork Growth Rate**: $y = (\text{This Month Fork} / (\text{Prev 3 Months Avg Fork} + 1)) \times 100$

$$ Score\_Growth = 0.5 \times \min(x, 200)/2 + 0.5 \times \min(y, 200)/2 $$

⚠️ *Growth rate capped at 200% (Score 100) to prevent small projects from exploding scores due to small baselines.*

#### 🔥 Activity — 40%
- **Commit Trend**:
  $$ Ratio\_z = (\text{Last Week Avg Commit} + 1) / (\text{This Month Avg Commit} + 1) $$
  $$ Score\_z = \text{clamp}(0, 100, 50 + (Ratio\_z - 1) \times 50) $$

- **OpenDigger Activity**:
  $$ Score\_m = \min(100, OpenDigger\_Activity \times 10) $$

- **Final Score**:
  $$ Score\_Activity = 0.3 \times Score\_z + 0.7 \times Score\_m $$

| Ratio Value | Meaning | Score Trend |
|:-----------:|---------|:-----------:|
| > 1 | Activity Rising ↑ | > 50 |
| = 1 | Stable → | = 50 |
| < 1 | Activity Falling ↓ | < 50 |

#### 🤝 Contribution — 20%
$$ Ratio\_n = (\text{Last Week Avg PR} + 1) / (\text{This Month Avg PR} + 1) $$
$$ Score\_Contrib = \text{clamp}(0, 100, 50 + (Ratio\_n - 1) \times 50) $$

#### 💻 Code Churn (Code Health) — 20%
- **Total Churn**: $q = \text{Lines Added} + \text{Lines Deleted}$
$$ Score\_Code = \min(100, 20 \times \log_{10}(q + 1)) $$

| Churn $q$ | $\log_{10}(q+1)$ | Score |
|:---------:|:----------------:|:-----:|
| 100 Lines | ≈ 2 | 40 |
| 1,000 Lines | ≈ 3 | 60 |
| 10,000 Lines | ≈ 4 | 80 |
| 100,000 Lines | ≈ 5 | 100 |

            - pull_deletions          Lines of code deleted
    
    Returns:
        float: Health Score (0-100)
    """
    
    # 1. Growth (Star & Fork) - 20%
    s_score = min((data['star_current_month'] / (data['star_avg_prev_3m'] + 1)) * 100, 200) / 2
    f_score = min((data['fork_current_month'] / (data['fork_avg_prev_3m'] + 1)) * 100, 200) / 2
    score_growth = 0.5 * s_score + 0.5 * f_score

    # 2. Activity (Commit & OpenDigger) - 40%
    c_ratio = (data['commit_avg_last_week'] + 1) / (data['commit_avg_month'] + 1)
    score_z = max(0, min(100, 50 + (c_ratio - 1) * 50))
    score_m = min(100, data['opendigger_activity'] * 10)
    score_activity = 0.3 * score_z + 0.7 * score_m

    # 3. Contribution (PR Trend) - 20%
    p_ratio = (data['pr_avg_last_week'] + 1) / (data['pr_avg_month'] + 1)
    score_contrib = max(0, min(100, 50 + (p_ratio - 1) * 50))

    # 4. Code Churn - 20%
    total_churn = data['pull_additions'] + data['pull_deletions']
    score_code = min(100, 20 * math.log10(total_churn + 1))

    # Final Aggregation
    final_score = (
        0.2 * score_growth +
        0.4 * score_activity +
        0.2 * score_contrib +
        0.2 * score_code
    )

    return round(final_score, 2)
```

## Project Backend Errors
When backend data fails to transmit to the frontend, a prompt will appear on the frontend, allowing developers to improve the backend based on this hint.
