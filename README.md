## Health Assessment Algorithm

### PHAM - Project Health Assessment Model
Core algorithm that quantitatively evaluates open source project health, outputting a score from **0 to 100**.

### Overall Formula
```
M = 0.2 × Growth + 0.4 × Activity + 0.2 × Contribution + 0.2 × Code
```

### Four-Dimensional Assessment System

| Dimension | Weight | Key Metrics | Description |
|-----------|:------:|-------------|-------------|
| **Growth** | 20% | Star / Fork growth rate | Community attention |
| **Activity** | 40% | Commit trends + OpenDigger | Development activity (core) |
| **Contribution** | 20% | PR trends | Community contribution intensity |
| **Code Churn** | 20% | Code changes (logarithmic) | Development throughput |

### Detailed Calculation Logic

#### ⭐ Growth (Attention Growth) — 20%
```
Star growth rate:  x = (Current month Stars / (Previous 3 months avg Stars + 1)) × 100
Fork growth rate:  y = (Current month Forks / (Previous 3 months avg Forks + 1)) × 100

Score_Growth = 0.5 × min(x, 200)/2 + 0.5 × min(y, 200)/2

⚠️ Growth rate capped at 200% (score 100) to prevent score explosion from small base numbers
```

#### 🔥 Activity — 40%
```
Commit Trend:
Ratio_z = (Last week avg Commits + 1) / (Monthly avg Commits + 1)
Score_z = clamp(0, 100, 50 + (Ratio_z − 1) × 50)

OpenDigger Activity:
Score_m = min(100, OpenDigger_Activity × 10)

Final Score:
Score_Activity = 0.3 × Score_z + 0.7 × Score_m
```

| Ratio Value | Meaning | Score Trend |
|:-----------:|---------|:-----------:|
| `> 1` | Activity rising ↑ | `> 50` |
| `= 1` | Stable → | `= 50` |
| `< 1` | Activity declining ↓ | `< 50` |

#### 🤝 Contribution — 20%
```
Ratio_n = (Last week avg PRs + 1) / (Monthly avg PRs + 1)
Score_Contrib = clamp(0, 100, 50 + (Ratio_n − 1) × 50)
```

#### 💻 Code Churn (Code Health) — 20%
```
Total churn:  q = Lines added + Lines deleted
Score_Code = min(100, 20 × log₁₀(q + 1))
```

| Churn q | log₁₀(q+1) | Score |
|:-------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| 100 lines | ≈ 2 | 40 |
| 1,000 lines | ≈ 3 | 60 |
| 10,000 lines | ≈ 4 | 80 |
| 100,000 lines | ≈ 5 | 100 |

### Algorithm Implementation

import math

def calculate_health_score(data):
    """
    Calculate project health score
    
    Args:
        data: dict, containing the following fields:
            - star_current_month      Stars added this month
            - star_avg_prev_3m        Average Stars over previous 3 months
            - fork_current_month      Forks added this month

            - pr_avg_last_week        Average PRs last week
            - pr_avg_month            Average PRs this month
            - pull_additions          Lines of code added
            - pull_deletions          Lines of code deleted
    
    Returns:
        float: Health score (0-100)
    """
    
    # 1. Growth (Star & Fork) - 20%
    s_score = min((data['star_current_month'] / (data['star_avg_prev_3m'] + 1)) * 100, 200) / 2
    f_score = min((data['fork_current_month'] / (data['fork_avg_prev_3m'] + 1)) * 100, 200) / 2
    score_growth = 0.5 * s_score + 0.5 * f_score

    # 2. Activity (Commit & OpenDigger) - 40%
    c_ratio = (data['commit_avg_last_week'] + 1) / (data['commit_avg_month'] + 1)
    score_z = max(0, min(100, 50 + (c_ratio - 1) * 50))
    score_m = min(100, data['opendigger_activity'] * 10)
    score_activity = 0.3 * score_z + 0.7 * score_m

    # 3. Contribution (PR Trend) - 20%
    p_ratio = (data['pr_avg_last_week'] + 1) / (data['pr_avg_month'] + 1)
    score_contrib = max(0, min(100, 50 + (p_ratio - 1) * 50))

    # 4. Code Churn - 20%
    total_churn = data['pull_additions'] + data['pull_deletions']
    score_code = min(100, 20 * math.log10(total_churn + 1))

    # Final Aggregation
    final_score = (
        0.2 * score_growth +
        0.4 * score_activity +
        0.2 * score_contrib +
        0.2 * score_code
    )

    return round(final_score, 2)
```

## Backend Error Handling
When backend data fails to transmit to the frontend, a notification will pop up in the frontend. Developers can use this notification to improve the backend.
